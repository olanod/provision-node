## Blockchain node

A provision script to make my life easier setting up a substrate based blockchain node
on an Archlinux server(using in my personal machine and as a Linode StackScript).  

### tools
`node_fetch` downloads the latest github release artifact in the specified repo.
`node_enable` creates a container image that can be launched with `machinectl`.
